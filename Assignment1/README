Assignment 1 - Unix System Calls and Library Functions

The goal of this homework is to become familiar with the environment in hoare while practising system calls by doing 
Exercise 3.8 (p. 87) in your text by Robbins/Robbins. The exercise expands on the process chain of Program 3.1 in the 
book. The process chain is a vehicle to experiment with wait(2) and with sharing of devices. All of the processes in 
the chain created by Program 3.1 share stdin, stdout, and stderr. The program should give some meaningful error messages. 
The format for error messages should be:		

	my_prog: Error: Detailed error message
	
where my_prog is actually the name of the executable (argv[0]) that you are trying to execute.
