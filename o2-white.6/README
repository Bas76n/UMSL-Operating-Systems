Assignment 6

Objective: 

	The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a memory management module for our Operating System
Simulator oss using the deadlock detection and recovery strategy to manage resources. There is no scheduling in this 
project, but it will use shared memory.

Details regarding the base program:

	oss.c handles the forking process and resource allocation via shared memory, a semaphore, and other mechanisms. User.c 
	is simply checking to see if resources are allocated and through the use of random checks will either continue or exit 
	and release allocated resources.
	
	
Instructions:
	
	A make file is included with the program.  Simply type make on the command line to compile the files oss.c and user.c.  
	The executable for this assignment will simply be called oss.  To run the program, simply type oss with the arguements
	-h
	-s x
	-l filename
	-t z
	-v y
	where x is the maximum number of slave processes spawned (default 5) and filename is the log file used. The
	parameter z is the time in seconds when the master will terminate itself and all children (default 20).  The parameter
	y determines if the logs are Verbose or not.
