Assignment 2

Objective: 

	The goal of this assignment is to read in up to 50 lines of strings from a file, that are seperated a line feed, into shared memory.
	Then we check to see if each string at the correct index is a palindrome, i.e. the same forward and backward, and to write palindromes 
	to palin.out and non-palindromes to nopalin.out.  It achieves this by forking off 19 or less processes to check the string at their 
	assigned index and using exec to call palin.c to do the check and file write. 

Details regarding the base program:

	Master.c handles the forking process while palin.c handles the critical section. The program should use the multiprocess IPC
	but I wasn't able to get to that part of the program.  I have the shared memory set up and in use.  The critical section occurs.
	I have the program running with the parent and one fork.  I unfortunately ran out of time for the control of the shared resources
	portion of the assignment.  
	
Instructions:
	
	A make file is included with the program.  Simply type make on the command line to compile the files master.c and palin.c.  
	The executable for this assignment will simply be called master.  To run the program, simply type master filename where "filename"
	is the path of the text file to read in.  The output files palin.out and nopalin.out will be created automatically.
