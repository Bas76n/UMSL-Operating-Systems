Assignment 1 - Unix System Calls and Library Functions

The goal of this homework is to become familiar with the environment in hoare while practising system calls by doing 
Exercise 3.8 (p. 87) in the text by Robbins/Robbins. The exercise expands on the process chain of Program 3.1 in the 
book. The process chain is a vehicle to experiment with wait(2) and with sharing of devices. All of the processes in 
the chain created by Program 3.1 share stdin, stdout, and stderr. The program should give some meaningful error messages. 
The format for error messages should be:		

	my_prog: Error: Detailed error message
	
where my_prog is actually the name of the executable (argv[0]) that you are trying to execute.

3.1 creates a chain of process.  It takes a single command line argument that specifies the number of processes to 
create.  Before exiting, each process outputs its i value, its process ID, its parent process ID and
the process ID of its child.  The parent does not execute wait.  If the parent exits before the child, the
child becomes and orphan.  In this case the child process is adopted by a special system process (traditionally
init with process ID of 1.  As a result, some processes may have a parent ID of 1.
