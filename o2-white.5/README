Assignment 5

Objective: 

	The goal of this assignment is to simulate a system clock, spawn children off, have them exit at a semi-random time, and then 
	send a message back to the oss program.  The oss program writes the time info to a log.  As the program receives messages, 
	it spawns a new process up to a total of 100 or until time runs out. 

Details regarding the base program:

	oss.c handles the forking process while user.c handles the critical section via a semaphore.  All requirements implimented 
	except spawning of new processes as ones complete.
	
Instructions:
	
	A make file is included with the program.  Simply type make on the command line to compile the files oss.c and user.c.  
	The executable for this assignment will simply be called oss.  To run the program, simply type oss with the arguements
	-h
	-s x
	-l filename
	-t z
	where x is the maximum number of slave processes spawned (default 5) and filename is the log file used. The
	parameter z is the time in seconds when the master will terminate itself and all children (default 20)
