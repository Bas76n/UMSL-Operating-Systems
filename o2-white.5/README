Assignment 5

Objective: 

	The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a resource management module for our Operating System
Simulator oss using the deadlock detection and recovery strategy to manage resources. There is no scheduling in this 
project, but it will use shared memory.

Details regarding the base program:

	oss.c handles the forking process while user.c handles the critical section via a semaphore.  All requirements implimented 
	except spawning of new processes as ones complete.
	
Instructions:
	
	A make file is included with the program.  Simply type make on the command line to compile the files oss.c and user.c.  
	The executable for this assignment will simply be called oss.  To run the program, simply type oss with the arguements
	-h
	-s x
	-l filename
	-t z
	where x is the maximum number of slave processes spawned (default 5) and filename is the log file used. The
	parameter z is the time in seconds when the master will terminate itself and all children (default 20)
